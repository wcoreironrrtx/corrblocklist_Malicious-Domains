# corrblocklist_Malicious-Domains
#Additional Context and Description of Product
#This file is a list of Indicators of Compromise (IoC), IP addresses and domains, associated with malware observed 
#by the MS-ISAC during the specified date range. These IOCs are pulled from our network monitoring services as well as submissions
#from MS-ISAC members to our online sandbox related to malicious files and phishing emails. 
#The list is first pulled as an aggregate of all of the data, and then validated and vetted by a team of Analysts. Any IOC found to 
#be lacking in confidence is then removed prior to the publication of this list.
#Recommendations
#If you are using this information in your network security devices, the MS-ISAC recommends reviewing and removing
#old indicators from previous lists as they are no longer being logged by the MS-ISAC and may no longer be malicious.
#These IOCs should be removed from your network security devices no later than 4 weeks after the last time they appear in this list.
